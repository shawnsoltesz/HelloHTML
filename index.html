    <h1>Kayaking Adventures Around Florida</h1>

    <p>
      In 2019 I was taken to Weeki Wachee to kayak for the day and I was not
      only mesmerized, but I was really interested in kayaking more. What better
      way to get a glimpse within nature that can only be experienced on water?
      That day on the water, while a two seater tandem kayak was a fun first
      kayaking, I wanted to give it a whirl solo. Not long after, a friend came
      to visit and I took him to Weeki Wachee. We both paddled solo and I
      quickly realized that this activity could be a lot of fun while enjoying
      Florida's weather and surroundings.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few more kayaking adventures and rental costs adding up, it dawned
      on my friend and I to buy our own kayaks! And that we did on July 4th,
      2019. Dick’s Sporting Goods in Tampa was having a sale and we came home
      with kayaks, life vests and whistle, and two paddles each. We were ready
      to explore the waterways St Pete had to offer, on our own terms. Leading
      up to making the purchase, I did some research to better understand kayaks
      beyond the offerings the rental services offer. I’ll share some of that
      information below along with a few highlights from local places to enjoy.

    <h3>An Adventure Highlight</h3>

      A raccoon shook us down in the parking lot for our breakfast before we
      launched at Weedon Island!!

    <h2>Kayaks Of Many Shapes and Styles</h2>

    <p>
      Like most things, these vessels are not one size fits all. Each styles
      offer various unique benefits and considerations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Inflatable</li>
      <li>Sit In</li>
      <li>Sit On</li>
      <li>Tandem</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here's a great website that compares some differences to consider when
      comparing sitting in or on a kayak, <br />along with a wealth of other
      kayaking resources from Paddling.com.
